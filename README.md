# CSS Template

This project provides common resources to help provide a consistent style across PSDI websites. The contents of the "public/" directory are deployed at https://psdi-uk.github.io/css-template/, and can be imported by other projects to use the PSDI style and elements.

## Provided Resources

### Webpages

The following pages are deployed to help demonstrate the PSDI style:

#### Mockup

**Deployed at:** https://psdi-uk.github.io/css-template/index.html

This page demonstrates what the PSDI style looks like, and includes various page elements to show how they appear in
the style.

#### Static Template

**Deployed at:** https://psdi-uk.github.io/css-template/template.html

This is a template which can be copied to other projects to make static HTML pages. The source code of it includes various TODO notes in comments to guide the user through parts they need to edit to customise the page.

#### AJAX Template

**Deployed at:** https://psdi-uk.github.io/css-template/ajax.html

This is a template similar to the above, except it uses AJAX scripting to remotely load the common PSDI header and footer rather than copying them. This incurs a slight cost in loading time, but the resulting page will automatically inherit any updates to the header and footer without needing to be manually updated. This is deployed alongside the static template so that the additional loading time be observed.
