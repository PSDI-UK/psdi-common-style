        <ol>
          <li>Copy this file (either from the repo, or by saving it) to your own project, and rename as desired. If you
            want the page to be the main page of its website, it should be named "index.html".</li>
          <li>Open the file with your editor of choice. Look through the file for all sections marked with
            a "TODO" comment, and follow the instructions to customise it.</li>
          <li>Test locally that the page appears as desired, by opening up the file with your internet browser of
            choice.</li>
        </ol>
      </div>

      <!-- TODO: Place content you wish to appear in a main body section of the page here. You can copy and paste this
       block (from the <div class="body-panel"> wrapper) to have multiple such sections.
       
       If you're comfortable writing raw HTML, you can do so directly. Otherwise, you can use an online converter to
       convert text in a format of your choice to HTML. For instance, you can use https://markdowntohtml.com/ to convert
       Markdown to html.
       
       Take care that this page already has a top-level header element (h1 in HTML, # in Markdown, etc.), so you don't
       want to add another in this section. The highest-level header in this section should be h2/##/etc.-->

       have multiple such sections, or delete this block if you don't want any. -->
